# Variational Autoencoders (VAEs): A Deep Dive into Latent Representations and Data Generation

## Overview
This repository contains materials for my tutorial on Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), which combine neural networks and probabilistic techniques for generative modeling. This project explores:
- Theoretical foundations of VAEs.
- Practical implementation in Python using PyTorch.
- Latent space visualization and data generation.

## Dataset Description
We use the Stanford Dogs Dataset, containing 20,580 images of 120 dog breeds, for fine-grained image reconstruction and generation tasks.

## Key Concepts
- **Latent Representations:** Compressed, meaningful representations of input data.
- **Variational Inference:** Probabilistic approximation for latent variables.
- **KL Divergence:** Regularizes the latent space for smooth transitions.
- **Data Generation:** Generating synthetic data from learned distributions.

## Tutorial Highlights
1. Preprocessing the dataset with resizing and augmentations.
2. Defining the VAE architecture:
   - Encoder: Compresses input data into a probabilistic latent space.
   - Decoder: Reconstructs data from latent representations.
   - Reparameterization trick: Enables gradient-based optimization.
3. Training the VAE and visualizing the loss over epochs.
4. Generating reconstructed images and performing latent space interpolation.
5. Visualizing the latent space using PCA.
6. Applications and future directions of VAEs.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/Rukayat-spec/Variational_Autoencoder.git

2. Install dependencies:
- Python 3.8+
- PyTorch
- NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn
3. Open and run `VAE_Tutorial_1.ipynb` in Google Colab.
4. Follow the step-by-step guide to explore how VAEs reconstruct and generate images.

## Results
- **Reconstruction:** The VAE learns to recreate dog images from latent representations.
- **Latent Space Visualization:** PCA reveals smooth and meaningful transitions in the latent space.
- **Loss Analysis:** Steady convergence of reconstruction and KL divergence losses.

## Challenges and Future Directions
- Fine-tuning KL divergence and reconstruction loss balance.
- Exploring hybrid methods like VAE-GANs for improved image quality.
